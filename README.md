# The-RWeb
The RWeb is a small website inside of GitHub, inside of HTTP. RWeb is completely free to contribute to and upload web pages on.

Just like the real web, the RWeb is programmed in HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language. If you wish to contribute, but don't know HTML, I suggest you go learn it. It will come in handy for more purposes than just making websites on the RWeb.
